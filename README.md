# Webhook Simplifier
 A simple yet effective way to communicate with webhooks from the command line.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x+
- [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
- A Discord webhook URL
- Access to Command Line (PowerShell, CMD, etc.)

## Looking for GUI?
 I've moved the GUI version to a new [repository](https://www.github.com/SirenGlitch/Webhooker-GUI) to separate it from this repo. This _shouldn't_ change update frequency to this repo, however as this is marketed as a 'simple yet effective way to communicate with webhooks', this repo will **not** be getting any updates that will make it similar to the GUI one (i.e. no advanced webhooking - embeds etc.)
